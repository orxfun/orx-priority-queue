/// A [PriorityQueueDecKey] is a more advanced [PriorityQueue] with additional features
/// mainly related to accessing or modifying already pushed nodes such as:
/// * checking if a node is present in the queue,
/// * getting the key of an already pushed node,
/// * decreasing or updating the key of an already pushed node.
///
/// This is often achieved by additional memory requirement; hence, it is separated from the [PriorityQueue].
///
/// Another fundamental difference of [PriorityQueueDecKey] from [PriorityQueue] is that
/// it behaves as a set enabled by the `contains` method.
/// In other words,
/// * the same node can be pushed to a [PriorityQueue] an arbitrary number of times with same or different keys;
/// * on the other hand, a node can only be pushed to the [PriorityQueueDecKey] only once; however, the node in the queue can be mutated.
///
/// The [PriorityQueue] requires more space to handle a problem with lots of decrease key operations;
/// [PriorityQueueDecKey] aims to be memory efficient in such situations.
/// On the other hand, [PriorityQueue] could be preferable where number of such updates is limited
/// due to its lack of additional checks and tracking.
